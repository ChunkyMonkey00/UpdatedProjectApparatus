# Project Apparatus Client Updates

Just an updated version of [Project Apparatus](https://github.com/KaylinOwO/Project-Apparatus/tree/main/ProjectApparatus).
Find the UC version here: [<Release> Project Apparatus Updated ](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/lethal-company/620315-project-apparatus-updated.html).

## Instructions:

Download the prebuilt zip if you don't know how to build a DLL. Extract the zip ANYWHERE, go to releases > inject.bat, and run that file while Lethal Company is playing.

#### NOTE: You will need to turn off Windows Defender if you download the prebuilt. This is because Windows checks signatures of .exe and .dll files, and these aren't signed.
