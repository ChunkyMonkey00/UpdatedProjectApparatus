Just an updated version of:  
[Project Apparatus](https://github.com/KaylinOwO/Project-Apparatus/tree/main/ProjectApparatus)

### PREBUILT:
for the prebuilt release, go to releases and download the zip file.
 - As project apparatus isnt very clear on how to use, heres my instruction:

### Instructions:
Download prebuilt zip if you dont know how to build a dll. Extract the zip ANYWHERE, go to releases > inject.bat and run that file while lethal company is playing.

  #### NOTE: you will need to turn off windows defender if you download prebuilt. This is because windows checks signatures of exe and dll files, and these arent signed.
