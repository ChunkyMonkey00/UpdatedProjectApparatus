## Instructions:

Extract the zip ANYWHERE, go to releases > inject.bat, and run that file while Lethal Company is playing.

#### NOTE: You will need to turn off Windows Defender if you download the prebuilt. This is because Windows checks signatures of .exe and .dll files, and these aren't signed.
